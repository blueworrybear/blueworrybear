### Covergates

Covergates is my startup project which is to make the easiest way to setup a self-hosted coverage report service.
It's an alternative services to [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/), [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).
The reason I start this project is because I believe that:

- It's should be free for managing coverage reports for private repositories
- It's should be easy to start a self-hosted service
- It's should be simple and clear on reviewing coverage reports

If you are interesting in this project, here is the portal gate :point_down: :point_down::
